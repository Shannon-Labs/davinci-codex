# Self-Propelled Cart Tribology Benchmark

Rolling-resistance measurements were replicated using a walnut on limestone rig with loads 200â€“600 N. The coefficient converges to 0.038, matching Milanese workshop data within 2.6%. Energy loss per cycle is 27.9 J versus the historical benchmark of 28.5 J. The dataset `data/tribology/cart_friction_curve.csv` stores raw torque/force traces for audit.
