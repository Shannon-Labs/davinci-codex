   • Seams: Overlap 50mm, double-stitched with waxed thread

3. BRONZE MECHANICAL COMPONENTS
   • Bearings: Cast bronze bushings, reamed to fit
   • Hub: Lost-wax casting, machine-finished mounting surfaces
   • Gears: Bronze gear set, 15:1 reduction ratio
   • Fasteners: Bronze bolts with hand-cut threads

WORKSHOP PROCESSES
──────────────────

BLADE FABRICATION
1. Layout helical pattern on workshop floor (full-scale template)
2. Rough-cut oak beams to +5mm dimensions
3. Steam-bend beams using wooden forms (8 weeks minimum)
4. Allow to cool and set for 2 weeks
5. Final shaping with hand planes to final dimensions
6. Drill attachment holes (bronze-reinforced)
7. Apply linseed oil treatment (3 coats)

COVERING APPLICATION
1. Cut linen panels with 100mm overlap all edges
2. Pre-stretch on wooden frames (tensioning devices)
3. Apply waterproof glue to oak surface
4. Position linen, work from center outward
5. Install bronze rivets while glue is wet
6. Apply final linseed oil sealant

MECHANICAL ASSEMBLY
1. Cast bronze hub in sections (workshop furnace)
2. Machine mounting surfaces with hand tools
3. Install bronze bearings (reamed to tolerance)
4. Assemble gear train (15:1 reduction)
5. Install crank mechanism (oak handles, bronze axles)
6. Test rotation by hand (smooth operation required)

QUALITY CONTROL
────────────────

DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY
• Blade thickness: ±2mm tolerance

STRUCTURAL TESTING
• Load test: 2× design weight (static)
• Rotation test: 150% design RPM (5 minutes)
• Vibration test: No excessive vibration at operating speed
• Alignment test: True rotation within 2mm

MATERIAL INSPECTION
• Oak: No cracks, knots, or grain deviation
• Linen: No tears, consistent weave, proper oil treatment
• Bronze: No casting defects, proper hardness
• Joinery: Tight fits, no gaps, proper adhesive coverage

TOOLS REQUIRED
──────────────

WOODWORKING

Total Estimated Time: 34 weeks (approximately 8 months)

COST ANALYSIS
─────────────

MATERIAL COSTS (Relative to Oak = 1.0)
• Oak timber: 1.0 × required volume
• Linen covering: 2.0 × surface area
• Bronze components: 15.0 × component mass
• Hardware and fasteners: 5.0 × quantity
• Miscellaneous supplies: 3.0 × project size

LABOR COSTS
• Master craftsman: 40% of total
• Journeyman: 35% of total
• Apprentices: 25% of total

ESTIMATED TOTAL COST
Equivalent to: 3 fully equipped warhorses
Or: 2 years of workshop operation
Or: Master craftsman's 5-year salary

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS
────────────────────────

Based on material analysis and workshop capabilities:

MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE
• Lift capacity: 180 kg (pilot + fuel)
• Operating RPM: 120 RPM maximum
• Flight duration: 5 minutes (human power)
• Service life: 10 years (with maintenance)

LIMITING FACTORS
• Human power output (primary limitation)
• Material strength (secondary limitation)
• Control mechanisms (not addressed in original design)
• Weather conditions (wind, rain limitations)

MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────

ROUTINE MAINTENANCE
• Weekly: Linen tension inspection
• Monthly: Bronze bearing lubrication
• Quarterly: Wood integrity inspection
• Annually: Complete disassembly and refinishing

REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE
• Linen covering: Every 3-5 years
• Bronze bearings: Every 8-10 years
• Wood components: Every 15-20 years
• Mechanical components: Every 12-15 years

CONCLUSION
───────────

This aerial screw represents the pinnacle of Renaissance engineering,
pushing the boundaries of what is possible with 15th century technology.
While human power limitations prevent sustained flight, the construction
itself would be a remarkable achievement, demonstrating:

• Advanced understanding of aerodynamics
• Sophisticated material selection
• Masterful craftsmanship
• Innovative mechanical design

The project serves both as a technological demonstration and as
educational inspiration for future generations of engineers and artisans.
