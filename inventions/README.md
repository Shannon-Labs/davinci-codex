# Invention Workspaces

Top-level coordination area for each reconstructed invention. Inside this directory, create one subfolder per slug (e.g., `ornithopter/`, `textile/bobbin_winder.yaml`). Each invention now belongs to a guild-aligned workshop category (`textile/`, `hydraulic/`, `workshop/`, `civil/`, `measurement/`, `agriculture/`, `domestic/`, `experimental/`). Use YAML manifests in each category to capture workshop-time estimates, materials, tool requirements, and master notes.

Complementary artifact layout for each invention slug:

- `anima/` — annotated folios, transcripts, JSON intent.
- `tva/` — historical simulations, stress analyses, viability notes.
- `synthesis/` — CAD sources, BOMs, validation results.
- `ip_nexus/` — prior-art reports, publication assets.

Refer to `inventions/catalog.yaml` for the global inventory and status tracking aligned with the 500-invention dissertation roadmap.
