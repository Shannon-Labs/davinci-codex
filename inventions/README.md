# Invention Workspaces

Top-level coordination area for each reconstructed invention. Inside this directory, create one subfolder per slug (e.g., `ornithopter/`, `self_propelled_cart/`). Each invention folder should mirror the pipeline:

- `anima/` — annotated folios, transcripts, JSON intent.
- `tva/` — historical simulations, stress analyses, viability notes.
- `synthesis/` — CAD sources, BOMs, validation results.
- `ip_nexus/` — prior-art reports, publication assets.

These assets complement the Python package under `src/davinci_codex/inventions/` and provide rich documentation/artifacts beyond the code-centric view.
