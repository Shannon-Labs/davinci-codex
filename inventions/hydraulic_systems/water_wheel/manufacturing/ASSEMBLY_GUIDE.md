Safety Notes:       Wear gloves when handling metal parts
Quality Check:      All dimensions within ±1mm

Procedure:
1. Inspect all frame components for damage or defects
2. Clean all mating surfaces with isopropyl alcohol
3. Apply anti-seize compound to all threaded connections
4. Position frame sections on level surface
5. Hand-tighten all connections initially
6. Check squareness with diagonal measurements

Leonardo's Wisdom: "Measure twice, cut once - but in assembly, measure thrice for perfection."

Verification Points:
- Frame is square (diagonal difference <2mm)
- All joints are flush and aligned
- No visible damage to components
- Threaded holes are clean and undamaged
```

#### Step 1.2: Bearing Installation
```
Duration:           60 minutes
Difficulty:         Intermediate
Safety Notes:       Use bearing press - never hammer bearings
Quality Check:      Bearing rotates smoothly without play

Procedure:
1. Clean bearing seats with solvent and lint-free cloth
2. Apply thin film of bearing grease to seats
3. Chill bearings in freezer for 30 minutes (thermal contraction)
4. Heat bearing housings to 80°C (thermal expansion)
5. Press bearings into housings using hydraulic press
6. Apply steady pressure - never impact or shock
7. Verify bearing is fully seated against shoulder
8. Check rotation smoothness and axial play

Leonardo's Wisdom: "The bearing is the heart of the wheel - treat it with the gentleness you would show a living thing."

Critical Measurements:
- Bearing seat diameter: 30.000 ± 0.010 mm
- Bearing bore: 10.000 ± 0.005 mm
- Press-fit force: 5-15 kN (gradual application)

```

#### Step 1.3: Axle Assembly
```
Duration:           45 minutes
Difficulty:         Intermediate
Safety Notes:       Support axle weight during installation
Quality Check:      Axle is straight and rotates freely

4. Verify proper engagement of retention features
5. Check bucket alignment and spacing
6. Test removal and reinstallation procedure
7. Verify no interference with spokes
