# Mechanical Odometer TVA Dataset

Slip benchmarks and material comparisons for Leonardo's survey cart. The data quantifies wheel slip
percentages for packed earth, flagstone, and cobblestone surfaces at representative loads (200â€“600 N), and
feeds the `validation/mechanical_odometer_contact` case alongside the main odometer simulations.
