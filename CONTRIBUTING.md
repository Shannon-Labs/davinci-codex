# Contributing to the da Vinci Codex Project

## Welcome Contributors!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the computational reconstruction of Leonardo da Vinci's mechanical inventions. This project thrives on collaboration between engineers, historians, educators, and enthusiasts worldwide.

## Ground Rules
- **License alignment:** All source code must be MIT-compatible. Generated docs, figures, meshes, and audio are released under CC0. Do not commit assets with unclear provenance.
- **Safety first:** Avoid weaponizable, harmful, or privacy-invasive concepts. If in doubt, open an issue before drafting a design.
- **Reproducibility:** Every addition should run headless via `make setup && make test && make demo`. Include deterministic seeds for stochastic simulations.
- **Documentation:** Provide provenance notes (folio IDs, catalog references), engineering assumptions, and ethical considerations in `docs/<slug>.md`.
- **Testing:** Add pytest coverage for new modules. Prefer unit-checked math and deterministic fixtures.
