2. Secondary: Merchant consortium (commercial interest)
3. Tertiary: Foreign courts (diplomatic exchange)
4. Contingency: Workshop resources (self-funding)

CONCLUSION
───────────

ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY: CHALLENGING
• Total cost exceeds typical workshop annual revenue by 3-5×
• Requires major patronage or ducal sponsorship
• No direct return on investment expected
• Indirect benefits: reputation, knowledge, patron relationships

HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: PRICELESS
• First systematic aerial vehicle design
• Advanced materials engineering for period
• Innovative mechanical solutions
• Educational and inspirational value

RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH PATRONAGE
Despite the substantial cost, the project's historical significance
and educational value justify the investment. The aerial screw represents
the pinnacle of Renaissance engineering and would enhance Milan's
reputation as a center of innovation and learning.
