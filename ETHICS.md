# Ethical Charter for the da Vinci Codex Digital Dissertation

The da Vinci Codex initiative seeks to honour Leonardo's principle of *dimostrazione*—truth proven through demonstration—while upholding contemporary ethical standards. This charter governs all reconstructions, analyses, and publications produced within the project.

## 1. Non-Weaponisation
- The project will not develop, simulate, or prototype offensive weaponry beyond historical documentation required for scholarly completeness.
- Mechanisms with potential dual-use implications undergo independent ethical review and, when necessary, redaction of actionable details.
- Contributors agree not to adapt project outputs for harmful applications.

## 2. Transparency & Provenance
- Every analytical claim references primary folios, secondary scholarship, and simulation artefacts with reproducible workflows.
- Provenance files (`PROVENANCE/`) capture archive metadata, reproduction permissions, and transcription confidence levels.

## 3. Cultural Stewardship
- Respect intellectual property and access conditions set by manuscript custodians (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Biblioteca Nacional de España, etc.).
- Release derived datasets under CC0 while preserving attribution and contextual information.

## 4. Human-Centred Impact
- Prioritise inventions that improve safety, productivity, and well-being (textile automation, hydraulic management, medical devices).
- Quantify ethical implications of labour displacement or environmental impact in the final evaluation reports.

## 5. Inclusive Scholarship
- Engage historians, engineers, artisans, and community stakeholders in open review processes.
- Document disagreements and alternative interpretations in the public record to encourage pluralism.

## 6. Data Integrity & Reproducibility
- Maintain versioned records of simulations, experiments, and datasets.
- Publish uncertainty analyses (see `METHODOLOGY.md`) to prevent overstated claims.
- Follow the `CONTRIBUTING.md` checklist: link pull requests to relevant `PROVENANCE` entries, attach FMEA updates, and pass automated lint/test/catalog validation before review.

## 7. Responsible Storytelling
- Present reconstructions as historically informed possibilities, not definitive proofs that Leonardo physically built the machines.
- Explicitly flag speculative leaps and provide rationale for inferred design choices.

Adherence to this charter is required for all contributors. Breaches must be reported to the maintainers, who will coordinate remediation and, if necessary, retract affected work.
