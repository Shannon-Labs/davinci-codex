# da Vinci Codex Professional Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic enhancements to professionalize the da Vinci Codex repository, transforming it into a world-class computational archaeology framework.

## Current State Assessment
- ‚úÖ **Core Functionality**: Robust simulation engine with 16 da Vinci inventions
- ‚úÖ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- ‚úÖ **CLI Interface**: Rich command-line interface with typer
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Extensive README and project documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Code Quality**: Some linting issues (reduced from 1000+ to 15 errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Professional Standards**: Need CI/CD, better structure, and tooling
