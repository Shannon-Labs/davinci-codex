# The Programmable Flute
**Leonardo's Automated Woodwind Performer**

> **Musical Precision**: The first programmable woodwind instrument, capable of performing complex melodies with precise finger coordination and breath control.

## Overview

Leonardo da Vinci's programmable flute represents an elegant solution to automated woodwind performance. This innovative device used cam-driven mechanisms to automatically control fingerings and air flow, enabling consistent and repeatable melodic performances for court entertainment.

## Historical Context

### Source Manuscripts
- **Primary Source**: Codex Atlanticus, folio 572r
- **Date**: ~1492-1495 (Milan period)
- **Related Sketches**: CA f.572v, Madrid I f.108r, CA f.1023r
- **Commission**: Designed for Sforza court musical entertainments

### Cultural Significance

The programmable flute emerged during Leonardo's exploration of musical automation:
