# Programmable Flute

## Overview

Leonardo proposed a cam-driven recorder on Codex Atlanticus f.572r that automates fingerings through a rotating barrel and bellows-fed airflow, enabling repeatable melodies for court entertainments.

## Historical Context

- **Folio**: CA f.572r
- **Date**: ~1492-1495
- **Category**: Music/Automation
- **Related Sketches**: CA f.572v, Madrid I f.108r

## Simulation

Simulates cam timing, airflow variation, and valve latency to estimate tuning stability across the programmed sequence. Outputs CSVs and frequency plots.

## CAD Model

Cam barrel, support stand, and recorder body are scripted in `cad/programmable_flute/model.py`.

## Status

Concept reconstruction pending valve timing experiments.
