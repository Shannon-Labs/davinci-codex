**Assignment Criteria:**
1. **Range Compatibility**: Voice ranges within instrument capabilities
2. **Technical Suitability**: Instrument strengths matching musical requirements
3. **Textural Balance**: Ensemble balance and blend considerations
4. **Mechanical Feasibility**: Avoiding over-complex mechanical requirements

#### Phase 3: Technical Adaptation

**Pitch Adaptation:**

**Range Optimization:**
- **Octave Transposition**: Moving voices by octaves to fit instrument ranges
- **Range Restriction**: Limiting extreme pitches that challenge mechanical capabilities
- **Register Balancing**: Ensuring appropriate voice distribution across registers
- **Tonal Adjustment**: Maintaining modal integrity while accommodating mechanical constraints

**Example Transposition Strategy:**
```
Original Voice (Soprano): C4-A5 (261.63-880.00 Hz)
Viola Organista Adaptation: G4-D6 (392.00-1174.66 Hz)
- Transpose up perfect fourth to fit optimal range
- Maintain modal relationships
- Preserve melodic contour
```

**Rhythmic Adaptation:**

**Mechanical Timing Constraints:**
- **Minimum Note Duration**: Shortest practical mechanical articulation
- **Maximum Note Duration**: Limits of sustained mechanical production
- **Transition Time**: Time required for mechanical changes between notes
- **Rhythmic Precision**: Quantization to mechanically feasible durations

**Adaptation Techniques:**
1. **Duration Adjustment**: Lengthening very short notes for mechanical reliability
2. **Ornamentation Simplification**: Reducing complex ornamentation to essential elements
3. **Rhythmic Regularization**: Aligning rhythms with mechanical timing capabilities
4. **Articulation Modification**: Adapting articulation patterns to mechanical characteristics

**Dynamic Adaptation:**

**Mechanical Dynamic Limitations:**
- **Limited Dynamic Range**: Restricted compared to human performers
- **Gradual Changes**: Mechanical systems favor gradual dynamic shifts
- **Consistent Production**: More even dynamics than human performance
- **Fixed Parameters**: Less dynamic flexibility than live performers

**Compensation Strategies:**
1. **Registration Changes**: Using instrument combinations for dynamic contrast
2. **Textural Variation**: Adding or removing voices for dynamic effect
3. **Articulation Patterns**: Using articulation for perceived dynamic changes
4. **Structural Contrast**: Formal contrast instead of dynamic variation

#### Phase 4: Validation and Refinement

**Feasibility Analysis:**

**Mechanical Constraints Assessment:**
- **Pitch Range Verification**: All notes within instrument capabilities
- **Duration Validation**: Note lengths mechanically feasible
- **Transition Analysis**: Note-to-note transitions mechanically possible
- **Polyphony Limits**: Respect instrument polyphonic capabilities

**Musical Integrity Assessment:**
- **Modal Preservation**: Original modal character maintained
- **Structural Integrity**: Formal structures preserved
- **Expressive Content**: Emotional and aesthetic qualities retained
- **Historical Accuracy**: Renaissance style elements preserved

**Refinement Process:**
1. **Iterative Adjustment**: Multiple refinement cycles based on feedback
2. **Expert Consultation**: Musicological and musicological review
3. **Performance Testing**: Practical mechanical testing when possible
4. **Documentation**: Detailed adaptation records for reproducibility
