## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Complexity of Renaissance Music Analysis**
   - **Risk**: Difficulty accurately analyzing complex Renaissance music
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler pieces, gradually increase complexity
   - **Contingency**: Focus on most common Renaissance forms first

2. **Mechanical Constraint Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Underestimating complexity of mechanical constraints
   - **Mitigation**: Early prototyping with simple constraints
   - **Contingency**: Simplify constraint model if needed

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - **Risk**: Difficulties integrating with existing codebase
   - **Mitigation**: Early integration testing, clear interface design
   - **Contingency**: Create adapter layer if direct integration proves difficult

### Schedule Risks

1. **Underestimation of Development Time**
   - **Risk**: Components taking longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Regular progress reviews, buffer time in schedule
   - **Contingency**: Prioritize core features, defer advanced features

2. **Dependencies Between Components**
   - **Risk**: Delays in one component affecting others
   - **Mitigation**: Clear dependency tracking, parallel development where possible
   - **Contingency**: Create stubs for dependent components
