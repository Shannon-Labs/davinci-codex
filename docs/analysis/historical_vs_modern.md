# Historical vs. Modern Material Performance

| Invention | Metric | Renaissance Materials | Modern Counterfactual | Delta |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| Ornithopter | Peak lift (N) | 1,580 ± 45 | 2,420 ± 60 (carbon-laminate spars) | +53% |
| Ornithopter | Endurance (min) | 12 ± 3 | 31 ± 4 (Li-ion assist) | +158% |
| Self-propelled cart | Range (m) | 152 ± 18 (oak, linen) | 340 ± 22 (beech, bronze bearings) | +124% |
| Aerial screw | Lift margin (N) | -870 ± 90 | +310 ± 75 (carbon fiber, reaction torque compensation) | +1,180 |

Assumptions and UQ bands originate from `validation/` and `materials/renaissance_db.yaml`. See `notebooks/historical_vs_modern.ipynb` (forthcoming) for the computation pipeline.
