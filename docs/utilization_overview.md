# Utilization Overview

## High-Readiness Modules
- **Self-Propelled Cart** — Prototype-ready for educational workshops; elastic energy under 350 J keeps risk low. CAD is printable and dynamics are configurable via YAML, supporting quick classroom experiments.
- **Mechanical Odometer Cart** — Prototype-ready survey tool with <±1.3% error in baseline simulations. Passive mechanism and simple fabrication make it suitable for STEM programs or community surveying.

## Development Module
- **Aerial Screw Rotor Lab** — Remains in modeling phase; lift deficit suggests physical reproductions should be scale models only until torque balancing is solved.

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize workshop kits for the cart and odometer, bundling CAM-ready files and safety checklists.
2. Maintain digital calibration logs using the provided CSV outputs to compare field data with simulations.
3. For aerial screw work, pursue scaled wind-tunnel trials before attempting crewed prototypes.
