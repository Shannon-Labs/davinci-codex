# Utilization Overview

## High-Readiness Modules
- **Aerial Screw Rotor Lab** — Validated lift predictions and torque-balancing frame assessments make this module ready for publication and outreach demos with the packaged simulation artifacts.
- **Self-Propelled Cart** — Prototype-ready for educational workshops; elastic energy under 350 J keeps risk low. CAD is printable and dynamics are configurable via YAML, supporting quick classroom experiments.
- **Mechanical Odometer Cart** — Prototype-ready survey tool with <±1.3% error in baseline simulations. Passive mechanism and simple fabrication make it suitable for STEM programs or community surveying.

## In-Progress Modules
- **Pyramid Parachute** — Active descent simulations demonstrate feasibility, with physical validation and safety evidence in flight test planning before the module can be certified.

## Planning Modules
- **Self-Supporting Revolving Bridge** — Modern counterweight analyses exist, but deployment simulations and validation logs are still scoped; advancing these will unlock a status bump.
- **Ornithopter Flight Lab** — Simulation harness and pipelines are available, yet hardware validation and safety cases must be established before progressing readiness.

## Recommendations
1. Package the aerial screw, cart, and odometer artifacts as outreach kits with reproducibility checklists.
2. Schedule parachute wind-tunnel sessions and document the resulting safety evidence to progress the module beyond in-progress.
3. Prioritize revolving bridge simulation scenarios and ornithopter validation plans to transition both modules out of planning.
