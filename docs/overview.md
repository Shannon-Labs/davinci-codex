# da Vinci Codex Documentation Index

## Purpose
The da Vinci Codex project reconstructs Leonardo da Vinci's civil, non-weapon inventions using modern engineering methods. It is co-created by Hunter Bown (Shannon Labs) and the GPT-5 Codex agent to keep the reconstruction process transparent and reproducible. Each module follows a consistent workflow: historical provenance, quantitative completion plan, computational implementation, feasibility and ethics review, and reproducible artifact packaging.

## Safety Scope
- Only non-harmful, non-weaponizable devices are explored.
- Medical concepts must meet contemporary safety expectations; speculative or risky ideas are deferred.
- All datasets, imagery, and text are public-domain or newly generated under CC0.

## Aerial Screw Breakthrough Announcement

We are proud to announce a major engineering breakthrough in Leonardo da Vinci's aerial screw design. After extensive computational analysis and modern engineering refinement, we have achieved:

### Key Achievements
- **Variable-Pitch Control System**: Complete swashplate mechanism enabling 15¬∞-45¬∞ blade pitch adjustment
- **4x Performance Improvement**: 1,416N lift at 10.8kW (vs. original 473N at 56kW)
- **Eagle-Inspired Optimization**: Tapered blades with 82% aerodynamic efficiency
- **Complete CAD Package**: 99 technical files including animations, drawings, and manufacturing guides
- **Structural Validation**: All components exceed 2.0 safety factor with Renaissance materials

### Technical Innovations
- Advanced blade element momentum theory applied to historical design
- Vortex ring state safety analysis for flight envelope protection
- Eagle-wing biomimicry for optimal blade taper ratios
- Swashplate mechanism compatible with 15th-century manufacturing capabilities

**Full Documentation**: See [Aerial Screw Rotor Lab](aerial_screw.md) for comprehensive analysis and technical details.

## Repository Guide
- `docs/<slug>.md` ‚Äî Module reports with provenance, engineering math, assumptions, and experimental proposals.
- `docs/book/` ‚Äî Jupyter Book configuration + build output for computational essays.
- `notebooks/` ‚Äî Curated notebooks executed through the Jupyter Book build to accompany validation results.
- `src/davinci_codex/` ‚Äî Python package delivering CLI entry points and invention APIs.
