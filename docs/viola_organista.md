# The Viola Organista
**Leonardo's Bowed Keyboard Instrument**

> **Musical Revolution**: The world's first keyboard instrument that produces sustained, bowed tones - essentially a mechanical string orchestra playable by a single musician.

## Overview

Leonardo da Vinci's viola organista represents one of his most innovative musical inventions, combining the expressive power of bowed strings with the polyphonic capability of a keyboard. This remarkable instrument uses a rotating rosined wheel to continuously bow strings, producing sustained tones with the timbre of a viola but the playability of an organ.

## Historical Context

### Source Manuscripts
- **Primary Source**: Codex Atlanticus, folio 93v
- **Date**: ~1493-1495 (Milan period)
- **Related Sketches**: CA f.94r, Madrid II f.76r, CA f.1050v
- **Innovation**: Completely new instrument concept, unprecedented in musical history

### Cultural Significance

The viola organista emerged during Leonardo's intense period of musical experimentation:
- **Musical Innovation**: Creating a completely new class of instrument
- **Court Prestige**: Unique entertainment for Sforza court events
- **Technical Achievement**: Masterful synthesis of multiple technologies
- **Artistic Vision**: Expanding musical expression through engineering

## Design Principles

### Mechanical Architecture

1. **Rosined Wheel System**: Rotating wheels providing continuous bowing action
2. **String Array**: Multiple strings tuned to different pitches
3. **Key Mechanism**: Keyboard controls for individual string engagement
4. **Stop Mechanism**: Variable pressure control for dynamic expression
5. **Resonance Chamber**: Soundboard and body for acoustic amplification

### Key Components

| Component | Function | Technical Specifications |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Bowing Wheels** | Continuous string excitation | Multiple rosined wooden wheels, 4-6 inch diameter |
| **String Bed** | Sound production | 24-48 strings, gut or metal, various lengths |
| **Key Action** | Note selection | Keyboard mechanism with precise string engagement |
| **Pressure Control** | Dynamic variation | Variable wheel pressure for expressive control |
| **Resonance Box** | Sound amplification | Spruce soundboard with acoustic optimization |
| **Frame** | Structural support | Oak or walnut construction with iron reinforcements |
