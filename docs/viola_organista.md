# Viola Organista

## Overview

Leonardo's viola organista combines a keyboard with a rosined wheel that bows strings continuously, enabling sustained chords with organ-like power and viola timbre.

## Historical Context

- **Folio**: CA f.93v
- **Date**: ~1493-1495
- **Category**: Music/Automation
- **Related Sketches**: CA f.94r, Madrid II f.76r

## Simulation

Models wheel speed, string tension, and key attack envelopes to estimate pitch stability and expressive control. Produces CSV timelines and amplitude plots.

## CAD Model

Wheel, keybed, and string rail geometry lives in `cad/viola_organista/model.py` for quick STL export.

## Status

Concept reconstruction; expressive envelope validation pending prototype trials.
