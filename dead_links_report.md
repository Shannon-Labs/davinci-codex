# Dead Links Report for DaVinci Codex Repository

## Summary

This report identifies dead links found in the DaVinci Codex repository. The analysis was performed on all markdown files (.md) in the repository, excluding the .venv directory.

- **Total markdown files scanned**: 83
- **Total internal links found**: 57
- **Total external links found**: 34
- **Dead internal links**: 1
- **Dead external links**: 1 (from sample of 10 checked)

## Dead Internal Links

### 1. Missing ABSTRACT.md file

**File**: [`README.md`](README.md:20)  
**Line**: 20  
**Link text**: `ABSTRACT.md`  
**Issue**: The file `ABSTRACT.md` does not exist in the repository root.

**Suggested fix**: 
- Create an `ABSTRACT.md` file in the repository root with the academic abstract for the project, or
- Remove the link from the README if the abstract is not yet available

## Dead External Links

### 1. GitHub Discussions Page Not Found

**File**: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md:179)  
**Line**: 179  
**Link text**: `https://github.com/Shannon-Labs/davinci-codex/discussions`  
**Issue**: HTTP 404 - Page not found

**Suggested fix**: 
- Enable GitHub Discussions for the repository (repository settings), or
- Update the link to point to an alternative communication channel like Issues or a different platform

## Additional Notes

1. **External Link Sampling**: Only 10 out of 34 external links were checked to avoid making too many HTTP requests. More dead external links may exist.

2. **Image Links**: All image links (PNG files) in the documentation were found to be valid.

3. **Cross-Reference Links**: All cross-references between documentation files are working correctly.

4. **Code File Links**: All links to Python source files in the `src/` directory are valid.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create the missing `ABSTRACT.md` file or remove the link
   - Enable GitHub Discussions or update the link in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

2. **Future Maintenance**:
   - Consider setting up a CI check that runs this link validation script automatically
   - When adding new documentation, ensure all links are tested before merging
   - For external links, consider using version-specific URLs when available to reduce link rot

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add a note in the contribution guidelines about checking links before submitting PRs
   - Consider using relative paths for all internal links to maintain portability

## Technical Details

The analysis was performed using a custom Python script that:
- Scanned all markdown files in the repository
- Extracted both internal and external links using regex patterns
- Resolved internal paths relative to their containing files
- Checked for file existence with fallbacks (adding .md extension, checking for index.md in directories)
- Performed HTTP HEAD requests on a sample of external links
