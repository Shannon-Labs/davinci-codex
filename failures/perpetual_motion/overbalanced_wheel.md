# Overbalanced Wheel Attempt

- **Iterations**: 30 variations documented across Codex Atlanticus folios 30v-33r.
- **Hypothesis**: Offset weights maintain continuous torque.
- **Result**: Wheel self-balances after half rotation; net torque drops below measurement threshold.
- **Insight**: Frictional losses dominate; annotated "friction conquers all" per Leonardo's marginalia.
