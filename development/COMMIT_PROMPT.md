## Task: Commit Leonardo-themed Jupyter Book changes and deploy to GitHub Pages

Your terminal got stuck in a multi-line git commit. Here's how to fix it and deploy:

## Step 1: Fix the Terminal
```bash
# If stuck in git commit quote mode, press Ctrl+C to cancel
# Then check git status
git status
```

## Step 2: Simple Commit
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with simple message (no fancy formatting)
git commit -m "Add Leonardo-inspired theme to Jupyter Book"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/Shannon-Labs/davinci-codex/actions
2. Wait for "Build and Deploy GitHub Pages" to complete (green checkmark)

## What You're Committing
- Enhanced Jupyter Book with Renaissance theme

## Expected Result
A beautiful GitHub Pages site with:
