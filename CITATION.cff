  A reproducible exploration of Leonardo da Vinci's civil inventions,
  rebuilt with modern analysis and open tooling. This project translates
  Renaissance engineering dreams into working implementations using
  contemporary materials, computational methods, and safety standards.
  
  Original designs and concepts by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) are in the public domain.
  This project builds upon da Vinci's genius to create modern implementations
  for educational and research purposes.
