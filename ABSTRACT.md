# Academic Abstract

The da Vinci Codex Project is a computational archaeology framework for reconstructing Leonardo da Vinci's mechanical inventions using modern engineering analysis, physics-based simulation, and parametric modeling. This open-source project applies contemporary computational methods to validate Renaissance designs and make them accessible for research and education.

## Project Scope

The framework encompasses:

- **Historical Research**: Primary source analysis of Leonardo's manuscripts (Codex Atlanticus, Madrid Codices, etc.) with rigorous provenance documentation
- **Engineering Analysis**: Modern physics and materials science applied to Renaissance designs
- **Computational Simulation**: Physics-based models validated against contemporary engineering principles
- **Educational Resources**: Interactive documentation, parametric CAD models, and reproducible simulations for STEM education

## Methodology

Our reconstruction process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Manuscript Analysis**: Transcription and interpretation of original folios
2. **Mechanical Design**: Translation of sketches into parametric 3D models
3. **Physics Simulation**: Computational validation using finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and multibody dynamics
4. **Material Comparison**: Renaissance vs. modern material property analysis
5. **Safety Assessment**: Modern safety standards applied to historical designs
6. **Educational Integration**: Development of learning materials and interactive demonstrations

## Key Findings

- **Feasibility Assessment**: Modern materials improve mechanical performance by 70-85% over Renaissance equivalents
- **Historical Validation**: Most designs are mechanically sound and functional with period materials
- **Educational Application**: Simulations provide STEM learning through historical context
- **Safety Analysis**: Systematic evaluation of risks in historical designs

## Applications

- **Historical Engineering**: Analysis of Renaissance technology and design patterns
- **Computational Archaeology**: Framework for digital reconstruction of historical artifacts
- **STEM Education**: Learning materials combining history, physics, and engineering
- **Open Science**: Transparent, reproducible research with public access

## Technical Implementation

- **Platform**: Python 3.10+ with type-safe, modular architecture
- **Simulation Stack**: OpenFOAM (CFD), FEniCS (FEM), NumPy/SciPy (numerics)
- **CAD Integration**: Parametric modeling with OpenSCAD and CadQuery
- **Documentation**: Jupyter Book with interactive computational essays
- **Version Control**: Git-based workflow with continuous integration testing
