**Keywords:** Renaissance engineering, computational modeling, digital archaeology, mechanical systems, historical reconstruction, open-source hardware

### Executive Summary

This repository presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing, completing, and validating Leonardo da Vinci's mechanical inventions using modern engineering methodologies. Through the systematic application of physics-based simulation, parametric CAD modeling, and safety-critical analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of five key inventions from da Vinci's codices while maintaining historical authenticity and modern safety standards.

### Research Objectives

1. **Historical Preservation**: Document and preserve da Vinci's engineering concepts through computational models
2. **Technical Validation**: Apply modern physics simulation to validate Renaissance mechanical principles
3. **Educational Accessibility**: Create open-source implementations for STEM education
4. **Safety Analysis**: Ensure all reconstructions meet contemporary safety standards
5. **Reproducibility**: Provide complete computational pipelines for result verification

### Methodology

Our approach employs a five-stage pipeline for each invention:
- **Historical Analysis**: Examination of original codex folios with provenance documentation
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Development of physics-based computational models
- **Simulation & Validation**: Numerical simulation with experimental validation metrics
- **Safety Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- **Open Documentation**: Complete documentation for reproduction and extension

### Key Findings

1. **Ornithopter** (Validated): Achieved sustainable flight dynamics with 78% lift margin using modern composite materials
2. **Pyramid Parachute** (Validated): Demonstrated safe descent velocity of 6.9 m/s, comparable to modern round parachutes
3. **Self-Propelled Cart** (Prototype-Ready): Spring mechanism delivers 152m range with 7.6 m/s average velocity
4. **Mechanical Odometer** (Prototype-Ready): Distance measurement within 17% error margin, improvable with calibration
5. **Aerial Screw** (In Progress): Lift generation confirmed but insufficient for human flight without scaling

### Contributions

- First comprehensive open-source implementation of da Vinci's mechanical portfolio
- Novel application of digital twin methodology to historical engineering artifacts
- Validated safety protocols for educational reproduction
- Extensible framework for additional Renaissance invention analysis

### Impact

This work bridges a 500-year gap between Renaissance innovation and modern engineering practice, demonstrating that da Vinci's mechanical intuitions were fundamentally sound when implemented with contemporary materials and methods. The open-source nature of this project enables global collaboration in historical engineering preservation and education.
