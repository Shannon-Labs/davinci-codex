# Analysis Scripts

This directory contains analysis and computational scripts for Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.

## Scripts

- `aerial_screw_blade_pitch_study.py` - Comprehensive analysis of aerial screw blade pitch optimization
- `energy_budget.py` - Energy budget analysis for various inventions
- `lion_power_analysis.py` - Power requirements analysis for the mechanical lion
- `materials_analysis.py` - Historical materials analysis and property evaluation
- `spring_system_design.py` - Spring mechanism design and analysis
- `vortex_simulation.py` - Vortex dynamics simulation for aerial devices
- `weight_system_design.py` - Weight distribution and structural analysis

## Usage

These scripts are standalone analysis tools that can be run to explore specific aspects of Leonardo's inventions. They are part of the computational archaeology framework and provide detailed engineering insights.

```bash
cd analysis/
python aerial_screw_blade_pitch_study.py
```

## Dependencies

These scripts require the main da Vinci Codex package to be installed:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
