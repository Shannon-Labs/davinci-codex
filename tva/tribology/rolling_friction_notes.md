# Rolling Friction Replication Notes

- Fixture replicates 16th-century Milanese workshop dimensions: walnut rim, linen tread, limestone paving block.
- Applied loads stepped from 200–600 N using calibrated iron weights; torque recorded with 0.1 Nm resolution.
- Temperature and humidity stabilised at 20 °C / 55% RH.
- Raw torque readings stored at `data/tribology/cart_friction_curve.csv`.
- Derived coefficient results appear in `validation/cart_tribology/load_sweep.csv`.
