# Temporal Viability Analyzer (TVA)

Historical simulation utilities mapping da Vinci designs to Renaissance material limits. TVA scenarios replicate 15th–16th century supply chains (woods, cordage, leather, early metallurgy) and run against the component graph surfaced by ANIMA. Modules:

- `materials/` — elastic/plastic data and failure envelopes for period substances.
- `simulations/` — quasi-static, dynamic, and fatigue solvers tuned for pre-industrial tolerances.
- `reports/` — structured summaries explaining failure points, earliest viable eras, and upgrade paths.

TVA outputs feed both Synthesis (modern redesign targets) and IP Nexus (historical context in defensive publications).
