## Core Architecture & Innovations

### Research Foundation Layer
#### Manuscript Provenance System
- `PROVENANCE/enhanced_manuscript_registry.yaml` codifies CIDOC-CRM compliant metadata, folio identifiers, archive endpoints, and authenticity notes for each source manuscript.
- Provenance checks are exercised inside `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline.py::test_historical_provenance_integration`, ensuring every simulation can surface folio and manuscript context.
- Historical narratives, safety charters, and methodology details live in `METHODOLOGY.md`, `ETHICS.md`, and topical docs under `docs/`.

#### Renaissance Materials & Modern Comparisons
- `materials/renaissance_db.yaml` stores period material properties with uncertainty distributions, fatigue limits, and sustainability tags alongside modern composites for delta analysis.
- `src/multiphysics/materials.py` delivers sampling, degradation modeling, and optimization utilities that compare Renaissance and contemporary materials, feeding both simulations and FMEA workflows.
- Validation hooks in `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline.py::test_material_database_integration` confirm material metadata is threaded through planning and evaluation steps.

### Computational Modeling Core
#### Multi-Physics Simulation Framework
- `src/multiphysics/core.py`, `aerodynamics.py`, `structures.py`, `materials.py`, and `collaboration.py` provide coupled fluid-structure, thermal, fatigue, and acoustics solvers with configurable coupling strategies and adaptive timestep control.
- Simulation parameters are defined through dataclasses (`SimulationParameters`, `MaterialProperties`) for reproducibility, exportable to VTK and HDF5 via pipeline hooks.

#### Primitive Mechanical Library & Pipelines
- Renaissance mechanism primitives reside in `src/davinci_codex/primitives/validated.py` with SI <-> Renaissance unit conversions, backlash models, and gear synthesis utilities.
- Full invention implementations across `src/davinci_codex/inventions/` cover ornithopter, parachute, self-propelled cart, aerial screw, mechanical instruments, and civil designs, each exposing `plan`, `simulate`, `evaluate`, and `build` hooks.
- Pipeline orchestration (`src/davinci_codex/pipelines.py`, `src/davinci_codex/cli.py`) chains synthesis, simulation, evaluation, and artifact generation; integration is guarded by `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline.py` and targeted unit suites per invention.

#### Advanced Simulation Features
- Uncertainty quantification lives in `src/davinci_codex/uncertainty.py` (Monte Carlo, Sobol, tornado charts) with regression coverage in `tests/benchmarks/test_simulation_performance.py`.
- Safety and FMEA tooling in `src/davinci_codex/safety/fmea.py` ensures every pipeline delivers risk scoring; `tests/test_parachute_acceptance.py` and related suites validate safety thresholds.
- Collaborative review instrumentation within `src/multiphysics/collaboration.py` tracks expert annotations, decision logs, and provenance audits for scholarly transparency.

### Educational Interface Layer
#### Interactive Documentation
- Jupyter Book configuration (`docs/book/_config.yml`, `_toc.yml`) powers executable notebooks such as `docs/book/notebooks/interactive_ornithopter.ipynb`, `interactive_parachute.ipynb`, `interactive_aerial_screw.ipynb`, and `interactive_cart.ipynb`, each blending parameter controls, validation plots, and knowledge checks.
- Supporting assets (`docs/book/_static/interactive-elements.css`, `docs/book/_static/leonardo-theme.css`) implement Renaissance-inspired styling while preserving accessibility.
- Physics derivations and validation studies under `docs/book/physics/` align analytic baselines with surrogate simulations for classroom transparency.

#### Curriculum & Maker Integration
- `education/README.md` outlines cross-grade scaffolding and directory conventions; the elementary module (`education/curricula/elementary/flying_machines_module.md`) aligns activities to NGSS/Common Core with hands-on challenges, assessments, and differentiation strategies.
- Maker and simulation outputs (STLs, trajectories, images) are curated in `cad/`, `sims/`, and `docs/images/`, enabling 3D printing and physical prototyping workflows referenced in curriculum plans.
- Lesson extensions leverage CLI/Jupyter tasks, encouraging students to explore parameter sweeps and safety analyses within controlled environments.

#### Web Demonstrations & Visual Systems
- `web/simulation_framework.js` delivers a reusable visualization harness for browser-based demos, sharing styling tokens with the documentation brand system.
- `web/ai_codex_explorer.html` and `web/leonardo_challenge_platform.html` provide interactive experiences for AI-driven exploration, community challenges, and live simulation showcases, optimized for progressive enhancement and mobile devices.

### AI-Powered Exploration & Collaborative Platform
#### AI Codex Navigator
- `src/ai_codex/interactive_navigator.py` models 50+ inventions (famous, lesser-known, rare) with metadata fields for complexity, completion status, historical sources, simulations, and 3D assets, enabling gap analysis and content planning.
- `AICodexNavigator.create_personalized_exploration()` generates adaptive learning paths based on user profiles (style, knowledge level, interests), assembling AI-authored explanations, modern analogues, and suggested experiments.
- The navigator exports structured data for downstream channels (web, VR/AR prototypes) and links directly to interactive demos and notebooks.

#### Community & Research Collaboration
- Collaborative APIs in `src/multiphysics/collaboration.py` expose review queues, provenance acknowledgements, and status transitions for interdisciplinary teams.
- Challenge platform prototypes coordinate historian, engineer, and educator participation with submission flows, scoring, and mentorship outreach.
- Governance, branching, and release management expectations are articulated across `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`, and `SECURITY.md`, ensuring open-science readiness.

## Routing & Navigation
- `README.md` supplies top-level orientation, while `ARCHITECTURE.md` decomposes subsystems and contribution pathways.
- Jupyter Book ToC routes readers from "Getting Started" to deep-dive physics and educational labs, with cross-links to provenance sheets and web demos.
- The AI navigator bridges code modules to folio references, enabling users to traverse inventions by manuscript, component reuse, or validation status.

## Styling & Visual Identity
- Brand guidelines in `docs/BRANDING_GUIDE.md` define typography, color palettes, UI components, and motion principles grounded in Renaissance aesthetics.
- Shared CSS tokens and imagery unify README badges, documentation themes, web demos, and educator materials while preserving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- Imaging assets in `docs/images/` present simulation galleries and comparative charts aligned with the brand system.

## State & Configuration Management
- Declarative dataclasses drive simulation parameters, while YAML manifests (`PROVENANCE/`, `materials/`) preserve reproducible configurations.
- `Makefile` tasks standardize environment setup, linting, testing, demo generation, and book builds; `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` capture dependency provenance.
- Registry and catalog modules (`src/davinci_codex/registry.py`, `src/davinci_codex/catalog/`) map inventions to modules, CAD assets, validation cases, and educational resources.

## External API & Data Integrations
- Archive metadata includes authentication and sync frequencies for Leonardo Digitale, Universal Leonardo, British Library, and BnF Gallica endpoints, laying groundwork for automated ingestion and IIIF viewers.
- Citation workflows use `references.bib` and `CITATION.cff`; `docs/index.md` and notebooks embed citation-friendly callouts for reproducible scholarship.
- Planned OCR and semantic tagging integrations are tracked in `ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` and TODO comments within `src/ai_codex/interactive_navigator.py` and `src/multiphysics/collaboration.py`.

## Quality Assurance & Testing Strategy
- Unit suites across `tests/` cover inventions, primitives, safety analysis, catalog schemas, and audiovisual models, delivering >94% coverage.
- Integration and benchmark suites (`tests/integration/test_full_pipeline.py`, `tests/benchmarks/test_simulation_performance.py`) validate end-to-end pipelines, performance regressions, and uncertainty propagation thresholds.
- GitHub Actions:
  - `enhanced-ci.yml`: multi-OS/Python matrix, Ruff/mypy, pytest (unit + integration), benchmark smoke tests, documentation build artifacts.
  - `security.yml`: Bandit, Semgrep, Safety, Trivy, detect-secrets with SARIF output.
  - `pages.yml`: Jupyter Book plus static site deployment to GitHub Pages.
- Pre-commit hooks and `make lint` maintain style, import order, docstring quality, and type guarantees.

## Success Metrics & Validation
- **Academic Impact**: DOI-linked outputs, provenance-first documentation, and citation-ready assets tracked via README badges and metadata.
- **Technical Excellence**: Benchmark goals (<5 s startup, <1 s parameter updates) monitored via performance tests; continuous comparison against analytical baselines (`docs/book/physics/`).
- **Educational Adoption**: Curriculum modules align with NGSS/Common Core; notebooks capture formative assessment prompts and automatically compute learning metrics.
- **Community Health**: Collaboration logs and challenge platform prototypes support expert review loops; contribution guidelines encourage safe, open participation with non-weaponization policies (`ETHICS.md`).

## Forward Roadmap
1. Populate middle school, high school, and university curricula under `education/curricula/` with lesson plans, assessments, and educator notes.
2. Integrate live manuscript imagery via IIIF using the archive endpoints enumerated in the provenance registry, feeding both AI navigator and documentation.
3. Expand immersive media (VR/AR overlays, narrated walkthroughs) and track them within `docs/media/` to complement interactive notebooks.
4. Automate CAD and fabrication exports and publish maker instructions in a dedicated `docs/maker_guides/` set with safety checklists.
5. Continue validating multi-physics simulations against experimental datasets archived in `validation/`, surfacing comparative dashboards in Jupyter Book and web demos.
