LEONARDO DA VINCI AERIAL SCREW - MANUFACTURING INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------
Blades: oak - select straight grain
Structure: wrought_iron - forged and annealed
Bearings: bronze - cast and polished

TOOLING REQUIRED
------------------------------
• Woodworking tools for blade shaping
• Metal lathe for cylindrical components
• Drill press for precision holes
• Files and rasps for finishing
• Balance stand for dynamic balancing

MANUFACTURING SEQUENCE
------------------------------
1. Machine central hub to precise dimensions
2. Create blade airfoil sections with proper taper
3. Machine swashplate components with bearing surfaces
4. Assemble bearing assemblies with proper clearances
5. Install control linkages with pivot joints
6. Balance all components dynamically
7. Final assembly and testing

QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST
------------------------------
□ Check all dimensions against tolerances
□ Verify surface finish on bearing surfaces
□ Test fit of all mating components
□ Balance rotating assembly
□ Verify smooth operation of pitch control
