# Assembly Instructions

## Pre-Assembly Preparation

1. **Verify all components** against drawings
2. **Clean all surfaces** and remove burrs
3. **Prepare work area** with adequate space
4. **Gather tools and fasteners**
5. **Review assembly sequence** before starting

## Assembly Sequence

### Phase 1: Central Hub Assembly
1. Position central hub on mounting base
2. Install bearing seats with proper alignment
3. Verify hub runs true (less than 0.5mm runout)

### Phase 2: Swashplate Installation
1. Install stationary swashplate on hub
2. Place bearing assemblies in races
3. Install rotating swashplate on bearings
4. Verify smooth rotation (manual test)

### Phase 3: Blade Installation
1. Install pitch control horns on blade roots
2. Attach blades to hub mounting points
3. Connect control linkages to swashplate
4. Connect linkages to pitch horns
5. Verify full range of motion

### Phase 4: Final Assembly
1. Install control lever and actuation system
2. Adjust safety stops and limit devices
3. Perform dynamic balancing
4. Conduct operational testing
5. Final inspection and documentation
