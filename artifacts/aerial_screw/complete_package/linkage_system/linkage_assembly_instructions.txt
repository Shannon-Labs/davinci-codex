MECHANICAL LINKAGE SYSTEM - ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS
============================================================

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
------------------------------
This variable-pitch linkage system provides precise control
of blade pitch angles from 15° to 45° using mechanical
advantage and bronze bearing technology suitable for
Renaissance-era manufacturing capabilities.

CRITICAL TOLERANCES
------------------------------
• Bearing clearances: ±0.1mm
• Linkage lengths: ±1mm
• Spherical joint fit: ±0.2mm
• Swashplate runout: <0.5mm

ASSEMBLY SEQUENCE
------------------------------
1. Install stationary swashplate on central hub
2. Install bearing assemblies with proper clearances
3. Install rotating swashplate on bearings
4. Attach control linkages to rotating swashplate
5. Install pitch control horns on blade roots
6. Connect linkages to pitch horns
7. Install actuation lever and safety stops
8. Test pitch control movement
9. Adjust linkage lengths for proper range
10. Verify safety stop operation

TESTING PROCEDURES
------------------------------
1. Verify smooth swashplate rotation
2. Check full pitch range movement
3. Test mechanical advantage
4. Verify safety stop operation
5. Check for binding or interference
