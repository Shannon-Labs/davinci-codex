## Conclusion

The comparative analysis reveals that both historical and mechanical approaches to Renaissance music performance have distinct and valuable characteristics. Rather than viewing them as competing alternatives, they should be understood as complementary approaches that together provide a more complete understanding of Renaissance musical culture and Leonardo da Vinci's innovative vision.

Historical performance preserves the human artistic expression that defined Renaissance music, while mechanical performance demonstrates the technological innovation that characterized Leonardo's work. Together, they offer unique insights into the intersection of art, music, and technology that defined the Renaissance period.

This analysis provides a foundation for continued exploration of both approaches, supporting ongoing research, performance, and educational efforts to bring Leonardo's musical innovations to modern audiences while preserving the rich traditions of Renaissance musical performance.
