# Operation Manual
## Leonardo's Mechanical Lion - Safe Operation and Maintenance

### Operating Procedures

#### Pre-Operation Safety Checks
1. **Visual Inspection**
   - [ ] Check for loose or damaged components
   - [ ] Verify all fasteners are secure
   - [ ] Inspect wooden frame for cracks or damage
   - [ ] Check for frayed or damaged springs

2. **Mechanical Systems**
   - [ ] Verify all bearings rotate freely
   - [ ] Check cam drum alignment
   - [ ] Test leg movement by hand
   - [ ] Verify chest door operation

3. **Operating Area**
   - [ ] Clear area of obstacles (3m radius)
   - [ ] Ensure level, stable floor surface
   - [ ] Check for adequate lighting
   - [ ] Verify crowd control measures

#### Winding Procedure
1. **Preparation**
   - Engage winding safety clutch
   - Verify winding handle is secure
   - Clear personnel from immediate area

2. **Winding Sequence**
   - Insert winding handle into winding socket
   - Turn clockwise until full resistance (â‰ˆ300 turns)
   - Listen for spring tension sounds
   - Engage main power clutch

3. **Safety Release Check**
   - Test emergency stop mechanism
   - Verify safety clutch disengages properly
   - Check all release mechanisms function

#### Performance Operation
1. **Startup Sequence**
   - Disengage safety clutch
   - Release main brake gradually
   - Allow lion to begin walking sequence
   - Monitor for proper gait and stability

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Watch for unusual noises or vibrations
   - Monitor walking gait smoothness
   - Observe chest reveal timing
   - Be prepared to engage emergency stop

3. **Shutdown Procedure**
   - Allow performance to complete naturally
   - Or engage emergency stop if needed
   - Disengage power clutch
   - Allow all motion to cease before approach

### Performance Sequence

#### Standard Performance (60 seconds)
1. **Phase 1: Walking (0-45 seconds)**
   - Lion walks forward in natural gait
   - Tail sways gently with motion
   - Head moves with lifelike motion
   - Covers approximately 8-10 meters

2. **Phase 2: Presentation (45-50 seconds)**
   - Lion stops and pauses majestically
   - Head turns to face audience
   - Tail assumes proud position

3. **Phase 3: Chest Reveal (50-55 seconds)**
   - Chest cavity doors spring open
   - Fleur-de-lis display rises
   - Dramatic pause for effect

4. **Phase 4: Conclusion (55-60 seconds)**
   - Display mechanism retracts
   - Chest doors close smoothly
   - Lion bows head slightly
   - Performance complete

#### Variations and Options
- **Extended Walking**: Additional 30 seconds of walking
- **Multiple Reveals**: Chest can open/close multiple times
- **Interactive Mode**: Manual control of specific movements

### Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Stop
1. **Immediate Action**
   - Pull emergency stop cord/handle
   - All motion should cease immediately
   - Power clutch disengages automatically
   - Springs remain tensioned but locked

2. **Post-Emergency**
   - Secure area and assess situation
   - Check for damage or issues
   - Determine cause of emergency
   - Repair or adjust as needed
   - Reset systems before next operation

#### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Lion won't start | Safety clutch engaged | Disengage safety clutch |
| Uneven walking gait | Leg spring tension incorrect | Adjust individual leg springs |
| Chest doesn't open | Cam follower jammed | Clean and lubricate cam track |
| Excessive noise | Bearings need lubrication | Apply wax/oil to bearings |
| Jerky motion | Obstruction in path | Clear operating area |

### Maintenance Schedule
