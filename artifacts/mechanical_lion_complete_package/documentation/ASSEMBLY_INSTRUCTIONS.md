# Assembly Instructions
## Step-by-Step Construction Guide

### Pre-Assembly Preparation

#### 1. Component Verification
- [ ] Verify all frame components against drawings
- [ ] Check mechanical components for proper dimensions
- [ ] Inspect all hardware and fasteners
- [ ] Confirm material quality and specifications
- [ ] Prepare workspace and tools

#### 2. Tool Preparation
- [ ] Sharpen all cutting tools
- [ ] Prepare workspace with adequate lighting
- [ ] Organize components by assembly stage
- [ ] Prepare clamps and fixtures
- [ ] Set up measurement and marking tools

### Phase 1: Frame Assembly

#### Step 1.1: Base Frame Construction
1. **Layout Longitudinal Beams**
   - Position two main oak beams (2.4m length)
   - Mark mortise positions at 30cm intervals
   - Ensure beams are straight and square

2. **Cut Joinery**
   - Cut mortises 25mm deep, 50mm wide
   - Cut matching tenons on transverse ribs
   - Test fit each joint individually
   - Apply hide glue and assemble

3. **Assemble Base Frame**
   - Assemble all joints with glue
   - Clamp securely for 24 hours
   - Check for square and alignment
   - Install bronze pins at critical joints

#### Step 1.2: Vertical Support Installation
1. **Install Leg Mounts**
   - Position vertical supports at leg locations
   - Cut bearing seats for leg pivots
   - Install bronze bearing sleeves
   - Verify alignment and smooth rotation

2. **Install Cam Drum Mounts**
   - Position cam drum supports in center of frame
   - Install bearing blocks for drum shaft
   - Align bearings for concentric rotation
   - Test rotation for smoothness

### Phase 2: Mechanical Systems

#### Step 2.1: Cam Drum Installation
1. **Install Main Cam Drum**
   - Position cam drum on bearings
   - Install keyway and secure shaft
   - Verify cam track positions
   - Test smooth rotation by hand

2. **Install Cam Followers**
   - Position followers on each cam track
   - Install return springs
   - Adjust spring tension
   - Verify follower movement

#### Step 2.2: Leg Assembly Installation
1. **Install Leg Mechanisms**
   - Mount upper leg sections to pivots
   - Connect cam followers to leg linkages
   - Install lower leg sections
   - Connect paw mechanisms

2. **Coordinate Leg Movements**
   - Adjust phase offsets for walking gait
   - Test leg synchronization
   - Fine-tune spring tensions
   - Verify natural walking motion

### Phase 3: Chest Mechanism

#### Step 3.1: Chest Cavity Construction
1. **Build Chest Frame**
   - Construct chest cavity frame within body
   - Install door hinges and latches
   - Ensure proper alignment and clearances
   - Test door movement

2. **Install Reveal Mechanism**
   - Install spring-loaded door system
   - Connect cam trigger mechanism
   - Install fleur-de-lis display
   - Test reveal sequence timing

### Phase 4: Final Assembly

#### Step 4.1: Exterior Finishing
1. **Install Decorative Shell**
   - Attach outer shell panels
   - Install decorative bronze trim
   - Add mane and tail features
   - Apply final finishes

#### Step 4.2: System Integration
1. **Connect Power System**
   - Install main winding mechanism
   - Connect power transmission
   - Install control levers
   - Test complete system

2. **Final Adjustments**
   - Balance all moving parts
   - Lubricate all bearings and pivots
   - Adjust spring tensions
   - Verify timing of all sequences

### Testing and Commissioning

#### Operational Testing
1. **Manual Testing**
   - Test all mechanisms by hand
   - Verify smooth operation
   - Check for binding or interference
   - Adjust as necessary

2. **Power Testing**
   - Wind power spring to half tension
   - Test walking sequence
   - Verify chest reveal timing
   - Check overall performance

3. **Full Performance Test**
   - Wind to full operating tension
   - Execute complete performance sequence
   - Monitor for issues or problems
   - Document performance characteristics

### Maintenance Instructions

#### Regular Maintenance
- Lubricate bearings monthly with wax/oil mixture
- Check spring tensions quarterly
- Inspect wooden components for damage
- Tighten any loose fasteners
- Clean and polish decorative elements

#### Annual Service
- Complete disassembly inspection
- Replace worn components as needed
- Refinish wooden surfaces
- Rebalance moving parts
- Update maintenance records
