# Leonardo da Vinci Mechanical Lion
## Complete CAD Package Overview

### Historical Context

This CAD package recreates Leonardo da Vinci's magnificent Mechanical Lion automaton,
built in 1515 for King Francis I of France. The lion was a masterpiece of Renaissance
engineering, designed to walk before the royal court and dramatically open its chest
to reveal fleurs-de-lis - celebrating the Franco-Florentine alliance.
