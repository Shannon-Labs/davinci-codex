# Manufacturing Guide
## Renaissance Workshop Construction Methods

### Required Tools and Equipment

#### Woodworking (Frame Components)
- Hand saws and frame saws for rough cutting
- Drawknives and spokeshaves for shaping
- Hand planes for smoothing and dimensioning
- Chisels and gouges for joinery
- Mallets and hammers for assembly
- Awls and braces for drilling
- Clamps and workbenches for assembly

#### Metalworking (Mechanical Components)
- Charcoal forge with bellows for heating
- Anvil and various hammers for shaping
- Tongs and handling tools for hot metal
- Swage blocks and forming tools
- Files and rasps for finishing
- Drill braces and bits for holes
- Saws for cutting metal stock

#### Precision Work
- Calipers and dividers for measuring
- Square and bevel for angles
- Balance stand for dynamic balancing
- Templates and jigs for repeatability
- Marking gauges and scratch awls

### Material Preparation

#### Oak Frame Components
1. **Selection**: Choose straight-grained oak, free from knots
2. **Seasoning**: Air dry for at least 1 year
3. **Dimensioning**: Rough cut to size +10% for finishing
4. **Milling**: Plane to final dimensions with hand tools
5. **Joinery**: Cut mortise and tenon joints with chisels

#### Bronze Mechanical Components
1. **Pattern Making**: Create wooden patterns for casting
2. **Molding**: Prepare sand molds with proper venting
3. **Melting**: Melt bronze in charcoal forge (≈950°C)
4. **Casting**: Pour molten bronze into molds
5. **Finishing**: Remove sprues, file to final dimensions

### Assembly Procedures

#### Step 1: Frame Construction
1. **Layout**: Mark all joint positions using square and ruler
2. **Mortises**: Cut mortises with chisels and mallets
3. **Tenons**: Cut matching tenons with backsaw
4. **Test Fit**: Dry fit all joints before gluing
5. **Gluing**: Apply hide glue, clamp for 24 hours
6. **Pinning**: Add bronze pins for reinforcement

#### Step 2: Mechanism Installation
1. **Bearing Seats**: Cut precise bearing seats in frame
2. **Cam Drum**: Install cam drum with proper alignment
3. **Leg Assemblies**: Mount leg mechanisms with bearings
4. **Linkages**: Connect control linkages and springs
5. **Chest Mechanism**: Install chest cavity and reveal system
6. **Testing**: Verify all movements operate smoothly

#### Step 3: Final Assembly
1. ** Exterior**: Attach decorative shell components
2. **Adjustment**: Fine-tune spring tensions and clearances
3. **Balancing**: Dynamic balance of all moving parts
4. **Finishing**: Apply oil and wax protection
5. **Testing**: Complete operational test sequence

### Quality Control

#### Dimensional Accuracy
- Frame components: ±2mm tolerance
- Mechanical parts: ±0.5mm tolerance
- Bearing fits: H7/g6 precision
- Cam profiles: ±0.1mm accuracy

#### Functional Testing
- Smooth operation of all mechanisms
- Proper timing of walking sequence
- Reliable chest reveal operation
- No binding or excessive friction
- Stable and balanced movement

#### Materials Verification
- Oak moisture content <12%
- Bronze alloy composition correct
- Spring steel properly tempered
- All hardware meets specifications

### Safety Considerations

#### During Construction
- Proper ventilation for forge work
- Heat protection when handling hot metal
- Sharp tool safety procedures
- Adequate lighting and work space
- Fire prevention measures

#### During Operation
- All safety devices functional
- Clear operating area
- Regular inspection of components
- Proper lubrication schedule
- Emergency stop procedures
