### Historical Context

The Mechanical Lion represents one of Leonardo da Vinci's most celebrated
automatons, combining sophisticated mechanical engineering with theatrical
showmanship. Built for the entry of King Francis I into Lyon in 1515, the
lion walked before the royal court and dramatically opened its chest to
reveal fleurs-de-lis, symbolizing the Franco-Florentine alliance.

This reconstruction maintains the mechanical principles and aesthetic beauty
of the original while providing the detailed documentation needed for
modern construction and education.
