## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Irregular timing | Loose drive components | Tighten all drive connections |
| Poor tone quality | Incorrect tuning | Re-tune to specification |
| Mechanical noise | Insufficient lubrication | Apply appropriate lubricants |
| Uneven tempo | Governor malfunction | Adjust or replace governor |
| No sound | Power system failure | Check and repair power mechanism |

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Mechanical Failure**
   - Disengage clutch immediately
