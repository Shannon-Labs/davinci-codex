# Automatic Pipe Organ - Performance Guide

## Introduction

This performance guide provides musicians and operators with the knowledge
needed to present Leonardo da Vinci's Automatic Pipe Organ effectively.
The instrument combines Renaissance mechanical engineering with musical
artistry to create unique performances.

## Musical Characteristics

### Timbre
Sacred, sustained tones tone quality that
characterizes Renaissance instrumental music. The wind
produces distinctive sounds that blend well with period instruments.

### Range and Capabilities
- Frequency Range: 100 - 2000 Hz
- Musical Range: 20 octaves
- Dynamic Control: Limited but expressive within mechanical constraints
- Articulation: Determined by mechanical design and programming

### Tuning System
Mean-tone temperament as was common in the
1500s - Self-playing organ. This provides authentic historical
sound but requires attention when playing with modern instruments.

## Performance Preparation

### Environment Setup
1. **Acoustic Space**: Prefer reverberant spaces similar to Renaissance chapels
2. **Temperature**: Stable 20°C ± 2°C for optimal tuning stability
3. **Humidity**: 40-60% RH to protect wooden components
4. **Lighting**: Adequate for audience viewing while protecting instrument

### Pre-Performance Checklist
- [ ] Visual inspection of all components
- [ ] Tuning verification against reference pitches
- [ ] Mechanical operation test
- [ ] Safety mechanism verification
- [ ] Performance material selection and loading
- [ ] Tempo regulation setting
- [ ] Sound check in performance space
