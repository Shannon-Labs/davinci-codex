MANUFACTURING NOTES - VARIABLE PITCH SWASHPLATE MECHANISM
Leonardo da Vinci's Workshop Specifications

MATERIALS REQUIRED:
- Bronze (Cu 88%, Sn 12%) for bearings and swashplate surfaces
- Wrought iron for control linkages (case-hardened at pivot points)
- Steel (case-hardened iron) for high-stress pivot points
- Oak or walnut wood for structural components
- Animal fat lubrication (rendered beef tallow) for bearings

TOOLING REQUIRED:
- Lathe for turning cylindrical components
- File set (rough to fine) for finishing
- Hammer and anvil for forging iron components
- Drill bits (hand-operated brace)
- Calipers for precision measurements
- Surface plate for checking flatness

FABRICATION SEQUENCE:

1. SWASHPLATE FABRICATION:
   - Cast bronze plates using sand molds
   - Turn outer and inner diameters on lathe
   - File bearing surfaces to within 0.5mm tolerance
   - Polish bearing surfaces with abrasive stone
   - Drill mounting holes using brace and bit

2. CONTROL LINKAGES:
   - Forge wrought iron to required diameter
   - Heat-treat ends in charcoal forge (case hardening)
   - Straighten using hammer and anvil
   - Drill holes for pivot pins
   - Verify straightness within 1mm over full length

3. BLADE GRIPS:
   - Machine steel pivot blocks
   - Drill precise bearing holes
   - Install bronze bushings (press-fit)
   - Attach to blade roots with iron bolts

4. ASSEMBLY PROCEDURE:
   - Mount fixed swashplate to airframe structure
   - Install rotating plate with bearing clearance
   - Attach control linkages to rotating plate
   - Connect linkages to blade grips
   - Verify smooth operation through full pitch range
   - Apply animal fat lubrication to all bearings

QUALITY CONTROL:
- Test swashplate rotation: must be smooth and consistent
- Verify pitch range: 15° to 45°
- Check control force: should not exceed 500N
- Inspect for binding at extreme positions
- Verify no excessive play in linkages

MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE:
- Weekly: Inspect all bearings for wear
- Monthly: Reapply animal fat lubrication
- Quarterly: Check linkage straightness and adjust if needed
- Annually: Complete disassembly and inspection

ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURES:
- Pitch range adjustment: Modify linkage attachment points
- Control force adjustment: Adjust lever arm lengths
- Friction reduction: Polish bearing surfaces, apply fresh lubrication

Remember: "Mechanical perfection is achieved through patience and precision.
Every component must move with the grace of a bird's wing in flight."
- Leonardo da Vinci
