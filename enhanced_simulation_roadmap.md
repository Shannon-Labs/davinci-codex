## VALIDATION & TESTING STRATEGY

### **Historical Validation Test Suite**

```python
# Example validation test structure
def test_ornithopter_historical_compliance():
    """Test enhanced ornithopter against historical constraints."""
    results = simulate_enhanced_ornithopter()
    validator = HistoricalValidator()
    report = validator.validate_invention('ornithopter', results)

    assert report.overall_compliance_score > 0.85
    assert report.mandatory_constraints_satisfied
    assert 'human_power_feasible' in report.validation_results

def test_aerial_screw_manuscript_accuracy():
    """Test aerial screw against Codex Atlanticus specifications."""
    design_params = get_aerial_screw_design()

    # Verify manuscript constraints
    assert design_params['helical_pitch'] == 3.5  # meters from 869r
    assert design_params['rotor_radius'] == 2.0  # meters from sketches
    assert design_params['power_source'] in ['human', 'early_steam']
```

### **Uncertainty Quantification Test Suite**

```python
def test_uncertainty_analysis_robustness():
    """Test uncertainty analysis produces consistent results."""
    uq = HistoricalUncertaintyQuantification()

    # Run multiple times with different seeds
    results = []
    for seed in range(5):
        np.random.seed(seed)
        report = uq.analyze_uncertainties('ornithopter', params, lift_function)
        results.append(report.total_variance)

    # Check consistency (should be within 5%)
    assert np.std(results) / np.mean(results) < 0.05
```

## EDUCATIONAL ACCESSIBILITY STRATEGY

### **Maintaining Approachability While Adding Rigor**

1. **Progressive Disclosure:**
   - Basic models remain as default for educational use
   - Advanced features available through configuration flags
   - Clear documentation of complexity levels

2. **Visualization Enhancements:**
   - Interactive plots showing uncertainty bounds
   - Historical constraint violation indicators
   - Side-by-side comparison of basic vs. enhanced models

3. **Documentation Strategy:**
   - Historical context for each enhancement
   - Mathematical background in appendices
   - Tutorial notebooks for advanced features

### **Backward Compatibility**

```python
# Configuration example
simulation_config = {
    'fidelity_level': 'educational',  # 'educational', 'advanced', 'research'
    'enable_historical_validation': True,
    'enable_uncertainty_analysis': False,  # Default off for simplicity
    'historical_constraint_level': 'strict'  # 'strict', 'moderate', 'relaxed'
}

results = simulate_ornithopter(config=simulation_config)
```
