The pine-hemp-wrought iron configuration provides the optimal balance of
structural performance, workshop feasibility, and economic practicality for
Leonardo's aerial screw. With 19.69× safety margin and 75% feasibility rate,
this design represents the pinnacle of Renaissance engineering capability.

While sustained flight remains beyond human power capabilities, the aerial
screw will demonstrate advanced understanding of aerodynamic principles and
serve as an invaluable educational tool for future generations of engineers
and innovators.

The project's true value lies not in its practical application, but in its
demonstration of systematic design thinking and the integration of multiple
engineering disciplines - a methodology that will guide technological
development for centuries to come.
