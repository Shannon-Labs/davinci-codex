# IP Nexus — Ornithopter Dossier

Open prior-art documentation ensuring the ornithopter modernization remains public domain.

Proposed files:
- `patent_search/` — Query scripts and CSV exports (USPTO, EPO, WIPO CPC B64C, B64F).
- `comparative_analysis.md` — Claim-by-claim mapping vs. modern ornithopter or flapping UAV patents.
- `defensive_publication/` — Draft article (Markdown + LaTeX) with embeds from TVA & Synthesis outputs.
- `licensing/` — CC0 dedication statements and SPDX-style metadata.

Upcoming work: run baseline semantic searches, log overlapping claims for University of Toronto ornithopter patents, and outline the defensive publication framing the modernization steps.
