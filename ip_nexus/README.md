# IP Nexus

Open prior-art publishing workflows that protect reconstructed inventions. Planned structure:

- `patent_search/` — adapters for USPTO, EPO, WIPO datasets plus vector-search helpers.
- `analysis/` — similarity scoring, claim mapping, and novelty gap detection using TVA/Synthesis outputs.
- `publications/` — Markdown/LaTeX generators for defensive publications, structured JSON for SPDX-style licensing, and automation hooks for Zenodo/OSF deposits.

Each invention registers a dossier capturing codex references, modernization steps, comparative patents, and CC0 statements to ensure the work stays in the public domain.
