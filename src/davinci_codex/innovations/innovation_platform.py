## API Development

### RESTful API Standards
- Use conventional HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Follow REST resource naming conventions
- Use JWT authentication for protected routes
- Implement request validation and error handling

### Example API Endpoint
```javascript
// server/controllers/projectController.js
const { Project, User } = require('../models');
const { validateProject } = require('../utils/validation');

exports.createProject = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { error } = validateProject(req.body);
    if (error) return res.status(400).json({ error: error.details[0].message });

    const project = await Project.create({
      ...req.body,
      creatorId: req.user.id,
      teamMembers: [req.user.id]
    });

    res.status(201).json(project);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Server error' });
  }
};
```

### GraphQL Integration
```javascript
// server/graphql/typeDefs.js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Project {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    description: String!
    teamMembers: [User!]!
    milestones: [Milestone!]!
  }

  type Query {
    projects: [Project!]!
    project(id: ID!): Project
  }

  type Mutation {
    createProject(input: ProjectInput!): Project!
  }
`;
```

## Database Design

### PostgreSQL Schema
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Projects table
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  creator_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### MongoDB Collections
```javascript
// Project details stored in MongoDB
const projectSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  projectId: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  challengeArea: String,
  inspirationSource: String,
  currentStage: String,
  milestones: [{
    title: String,
    completed: Boolean,
    dueDate: Date
  }],
  impactMetrics: {
    environmentalImpact: Number,
    socialImpact: Number,
    economicImpact: Number
  }
});
```

## Real-time Features

### WebSocket Implementation
```javascript
// server/websocket/socketHandler.js
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('join-project', (projectId) => {
    socket.join(projectId);
  });

  socket.on('project-update', (data) => {
    socket.to(data.projectId).emit('project-updated', data);
  });
});
```

### Frontend Real-time Updates
```javascript
// src/hooks/useRealTimeUpdates.js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

export const useRealTimeUpdates = (projectId) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = io();

    socket.emit('join-project', projectId);

    socket.on('project-updated', (data) => {
      // Update local state with real-time data
    });

    return () => socket.disconnect();
  }, [projectId]);
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
```javascript
// server/tests/controllers/projectController.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../../app');

describe('Project Controller', () => {
  test('should create a new project', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/projects')
      .send({
        title: 'Test Project',
        description: 'Test Description'
      })
      .expect(201);

    expect(response.body.title).toBe('Test Project');
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing
```javascript
// tests/integration/projectFlow.test.js
describe('Project Flow Integration', () => {
  test('complete project creation flow', async () => {
    // Test user registration
    // Test project creation
    // Test team member invitation
    // Test milestone creation
  });
});
```

### E2E Testing
```javascript
// cypress/integration/projectCreation.spec.js
describe('Project Creation', () => {
  it('should create a new project successfully', () => {
    cy.visit('/projects/new');
    cy.get('[data-testid="project-title"]').type('Test Project');
    cy.get('[data-testid="project-description"]').type('Test Description');
    cy.get('[data-testid="submit-button"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/projects/');
  });
});
```

## Deployment

### Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Docker Compose

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication
```javascript
// server/middleware/auth.js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

module.exports = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.header('Authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });
  }

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};
```

### Input Validation
```javascript
// server/utils/validation.js
const Joi = require('joi');

const projectSchema = Joi.object({
  title: Joi.string().min(3).max(200).required(),
  description: Joi.string().max(2000),
  challengeArea: Joi.string().valid('clean_water', 'sustainable_cities', 'climate_action')
});

module.exports = { validateProject: projectSchema.validate };
```
