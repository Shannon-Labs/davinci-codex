"""
Leonardo's Programmable Loom - The World's First Textile Computer
================================================================

Historical Context:
Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1495-1500) designed what may be history's first programmable 
machine in Codex Atlanticus folios 1090r-1091v. This automatic loom uses a system 
of cams, pegs, and mechanical logic to weave complex patterns - essentially creating 
a textile computer 500 years before modern computers!

This implementation demonstrates:
- Mechanical programming through cam-based pattern storage
- Multi-threaded textile physics simulation
- Renaissance precision engineering
- The birth of automated manufacturing

Modern Relevance:
This invention directly connects to contemporary digital fabrication, smart textiles,
and industrial IoT - showing how Leonardo's vision anticipated the modern maker movement.

Safety Note:
This reconstruction focuses on the mechanical principles and educational value.
All safety considerations include modern guards and emergency stops.
