DOCUMENTATION NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This document represents the culmination of Leonardo da Vinci's
mechanical genius and Renaissance craftsmanship. The chest cavity
mechanism must be constructed with utmost precision and attention
to detail, as it will be presented before the King of France.

Any deviations from these specifications must be approved by
Leonardo himself. The success of this mechanical marvel depends
on perfect execution of these instructions.

Remember: You are not merely building a machine - you are creating
a masterpiece that will demonstrate Florentine superiority in the
arts and sciences to all of Europe.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HISTORICAL NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This mechanical lion represents:
• The first complex programmable automaton
• A political gift celebrating Franco-Florentine alliance
• Leonardo's mastery of biomechanics and automation
• The pinnacle of Renaissance engineering
• A fusion of art, science, and theater

The chest cavity mechanism is particularly innovative as it combines:
• Precise mechanical timing
• Spring-powered automation
• Theatrical presentation
• Symbolic revelation (fleurs-de-lis)
• Reliable repeatable operation

This document should be preserved as a testament to Renaissance
engineering achievement and Leonardo's contributions to mechanical
automation and theatrical presentation.
